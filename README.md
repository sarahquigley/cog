## What is Cog?

Cog is an experiment in Javascript templating and CSS3 animations. The ultimate goal is to create a randomly generated set of turning, properly interlocking cogs.


## How does it work?

### Javascript Templating

Javascript templating is used to generate html and styles for each cog. 

### CSS3 animations

CSS3 animations are used rotate the cogs. 


## Did you create the design?

Yes, the design is my own. 


## Why did you make this?

This was a learning project in which I explored CSS3 animations and Javascript templating.


## Supported browsers 

Currently tested in latest Chrome (Chrome 35) only.
